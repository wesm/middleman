description: Use when a screenshot or short video needs to be captured with Playwright and saved to local disk, with optional upload through `gh image` (upload requires explicit user approval and must target a PR or issue).

# capture-playwright

Generate the artifact with Playwright and save it to local disk. **Do not upload by default.**

## Upload Policy

- **Never upload screenshots or videos that are not attached to a specific PR or issue.** Standalone uploads with no PR/issue target are forbidden.
- **Default is local-only.** Always save artifacts to disk first. Treat that as the finished output unless the user explicitly asks for an upload.
- **Before uploading any image or video, prompt the user for confirmation.** Use AskUserQuestion to confirm, stating the file path and the target PR/issue. No exceptions — even if the workflow calls for it, ask first.

Reference session: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/sessions/opencode%3Ases_2826059aeffeEtdyCVsVwnKi6R`

## Workflow

1. Prefer the repo's existing Playwright config and startup flow. Only add a temporary script or spec if no existing path can capture the state; delete temporary capture code afterward.
2. Save artifacts under a temp path like `tmp/` or `artifacts/` unless the user explicitly wants them committed.
3. For screenshots, use Playwright directly:

```js
await page.screenshot({ path: "tmp/capture.png", fullPage: true });
```

4. For video, create a recording context, close it, then resolve the generated file:

```js
const context = await browser.newContext({
  recordVideo: { dir: "tmp/video", size: { width: 1440, height: 900 } },
});
const page = await context.newPage();
// ... drive the page ...
await context.close();
const videoPath = await page.video()?.path();
```

5. **Stop here by default.** Report the local artifact path to the user. Only proceed to upload if the user explicitly requests it.

6. **If the user approves upload**, confirm the target PR or issue first. Never upload without a PR/issue target. Use `gh image` with `--repo`:

```bash
gh image --repo owner/repo "tmp/capture.png"
gh image --repo owner/repo "tmp/video.webm"
```

If video upload is rejected, keep the local video file, say that `gh image` appears image-only in this environment, and ask whether a screenshot link or a different upload path is preferred.

## Extension Setup

Check whether the extension is available:

```bash
gh image --help
```

If it is missing, install the extension used in the reference session:

```bash
gh extension install drogers0/gh-image
```

## Cookie Failure Mode

The reference session established that `gh image` may depend on GitHub web-upload cookies from a local browser profile. If errors mention cookies, browser profiles, `Local State`, `Cookies`, Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Chromium, do not assume `gh auth login` is enough.

Tell the user to sign in to GitHub in Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Chromium on that machine, then rerun `gh image`.

## Output

Return:
- the local artifact path (always)
- if uploaded: the markdown link(s) printed by `gh image` and the target PR/issue
- a brief note if video upload had to fall back to screenshots or another path
