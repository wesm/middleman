# Retries, Backoff, and Single-Flight Dedup

middleman has three distinct wait patterns. Keep them separate:

- **Transient retry** — short bounded retries for flaky upstream failures.
- **Rate-limit gate** — wait until provider quota resets.
- **Scheduling cadence** — steady periodic loops.

Issue #299 consolidates only transient retry under one shared package.
Rate-limit gates and cadence loops are intentionally separate.

## Transient retry: `internal/retry`

[`internal/retry/retry.go`](../internal/retry/retry.go). Canonical home for
`cenkalti/backoff/v5` orchestration. It wraps idempotent operations in a
bounded retry loop, retries only when the caller's classifier marks an error
transient, wraps all other errors with `backoff.Permanent`, and logs each retry
attempt at `DEBUG`.

Production schedule: 500ms → ~4s, jitter ±30%, 3 attempts.

**Transient retry sites:**

- [`internal/retry/retry.go`](../internal/retry/retry.go) — shared helper and
  production schedule.
- [`internal/gitclone/retry.go`](../internal/gitclone/retry.go) — git-specific
  transient matcher plus thin adapter into `internal/retry`.
- [`internal/gitclone/clone.go`](../internal/gitclone/clone.go) — retries
  `git clone --bare`, `git fetch`, and `git remote set-head`.

Use transient retry for idempotent work that hits flaky upstreams. Do not stack
it on top of paths that already retry (for example `internal/github` REST
client behavior). Test the shared helper against `DoWithBackOff` with a fast
injected backoff, and test package-specific callers for their own classifier and
budget choices.

To extend git transient matching, add a substring to the slice in
`internal/gitclone/retry.go` and a row to `internal/gitclone/retry_test.go`.
Keep the matcher conservative — false positives turn permanent failures into
multi-second hangs.

## Rate-limit gates

These paths are **not** transient retry. They represent provider quota state and
wait until the reset window.

- [`internal/ratelimit/rate.go`](../internal/ratelimit/rate.go) —
  `RateTracker.ShouldBackoff()` returns `(bool, time.Duration)` for exhausted
  quota windows.
- [`internal/github/graphql.go`](../internal/github/graphql.go) —
  `GraphQLFetcher.ShouldBackoff()` passthrough for GraphQL quota gating.
- [`internal/github/sync.go`](../internal/github/sync.go) — worker and GraphQL
  call sites that gate work on `ShouldBackoff()` before proceeding.

Do not wrap these paths in `backoff.Retry`, `RetryAfterError`, or any new retry
abstraction unless a separate design explicitly changes rate-limit policy.

## Scheduling cadence (out of scope)

These paths are also **not** transient retry. They define steady background
cadence.

- [`internal/server/server.go`](../internal/server/server.go) — ticker loops at
  lines 217 and 794 for periodic server-side refresh work.
- [`internal/github/sync.go`](../internal/github/sync.go) — ticker loops at
  lines 1370 and 1387 for periodic sync cadence.

Do not migrate cadence loops into `backoff/v5`; they are scheduling policy, not
failure recovery.

## Single-flight: `Manager.EnsureClone`

[`clone.go`](../internal/gitclone/clone.go). `EnsureClone` opens a
`singleflight` slot keyed on `(host, owner, name)` so concurrent
callers (periodic syncer, per-PR detail syncs, workspace setup) share
one underlying clone/fetch instead of stampeding GitHub.

Invariants to preserve:

- **Pre-check `ctx.Err()`**. A caller whose ctx is already canceled
  must not enter the slot, or the runner does work for nobody.
- **Key shape** `host \x00 owner \x00 name`. The null separator
  prevents `foo/barbaz` colliding with `foobar/baz`.
- **Detached, bounded runner ctx**. The slot runs with
  `context.WithTimeout(context.WithoutCancel(ctx), ensureCloneTimeout)`.
  Detached so one canceled waiter cannot abort work for others;
  bounded so a stuck git subprocess cannot hold the slot forever.
- **`DoChan`, not `Do`**, so each caller still observes its own
  `ctx.Done()` via the outer `select`.

Reach for a singleflight slot whenever multiple in-process call sites
hit the same upstream resource. Prefer dedup over retry — it removes
the cause, retry just absorbs the effect.

## Tests

Test the policy decisions, not the library. For retry that means the
matcher, the `backoff.Permanent` wrap, and the budget constant. For
dedup that means the key shape and the integration paths that
exercise the real cloneBare/fetch. Skip tests that assert "the library
loops" or "DoChan delivers to every waiter" — those are upstream's
contract.
