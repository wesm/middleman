# Testing

## Live GraphQL validation

GraphQL query shape changes must be validated against GitHub's live GraphQL API before they are merged. The local test suite includes a gated live test:

```sh
MIDDLEMAN_LIVE_GITHUB_TESTS=1 go test ./internal/github -run TestLiveGraphQLQueriesValidateAgainstGitHub -shuffle=on
```

The test uses `MIDDLEMAN_GITHUB_TOKEN` first, then `GITHUB_TOKEN`. It intentionally skips unless `MIDDLEMAN_LIVE_GITHUB_TESTS=1` is set because live validation consumes GitHub GraphQL rate limit and requires network access.

When changing structs, fields, aliases, fragments, pagination arguments, or nested selections used by `internal/github/graphql.go`, enable `MIDDLEMAN_LIVE_GITHUB_TESTS=1` and run the live validation test in addition to the normal Go tests.

CI runs the live GraphQL validation as a separate Go test step using the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` only in trusted contexts, such as pushes to `main`, manual `workflow_dispatch` runs, and same-repository pull requests. The general pull request Go test step does not receive a GitHub token.

## Provider work

When adding or changing a provider, pick tests at the boundary where users would
notice the regression:

- provider package tests for API normalization, pagination, auth/header shape,
  typed platform errors, and capability flags;
- config tests for provider defaults, host normalization, nested paths,
  duplicate detection, and token selection;
- DB/query tests for provider-aware identity and provider ID reconciliation;
- server e2e tests with real SQLite for route payloads, settings/import flows,
  and capability-gated actions;
- frontend store/component tests for provider refs and generated route helpers;
- optional live/container tests when fakes cannot validate provider API drift.

Regenerate OpenAPI and generated clients with `make api-generate` after Huma
route or API type changes.
