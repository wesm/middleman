# Database Migrations

`internal/db/migrations/` is append-only history. Once a migration is committed or under review, do not edit earlier numbered migrations to add new behavior. Add a new numbered migration instead.

## Rules

- Create the next sequential `NNNNNN_description.up.sql` and matching `NNNNNN_description.down.sql`.
- Do not modify old `.up.sql` or `.down.sql` files to account for new requirements. Historical migrations must keep describing the schema at the time they were introduced.
- If a previous migration in the same branch is wrong, prefer a follow-up migration that repairs or completes the state. Only rewrite an existing migration when explicitly instructed by the user.
- Keep `.down.sql` honest. If the data cleanup is one-way, say that in the down migration and only undo reversible schema artifacts such as triggers or indexes.
- Validate migrations through `db.Open()` and application-level tests. Do not test `golang-migrate` internals.
- For SQLite, remember that adding constraints to existing columns usually requires a table rebuild. Prefer a new migration with triggers when the goal is to enforce an invariant without rebuilding tables.
- When changing persisted data, test with real SQLite tables and representative child rows. Include dependent records that can be lost through foreign keys, uniqueness conflicts, or `INSERT OR IGNORE`.

## Migration Review Checklist

- The migration runs from the previous schema version to the new version.
- Existing rows are transformed before new constraints or triggers are installed.
- Foreign-key child rows are moved or merged before parent rows are deleted.
- Unique-index conflicts are handled intentionally: true duplicates are deleted, non-duplicate children are preserved.
- `PRAGMA integrity_check` and `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` are clean on migrated test data.
- Any real-data validation uses a copy or SQLite backup, never the live database.
